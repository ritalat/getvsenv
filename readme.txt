A small batch script to find a Visual Studio installation and set up the development environment
Works with Visual Studio 2005 to 2019 (and maybe 2022)

The script will either:
    a) open a new developer command prompt in the current directory if double-clicked in explorer
    b) set up the dev environment if called from an existing command prompt or another script
